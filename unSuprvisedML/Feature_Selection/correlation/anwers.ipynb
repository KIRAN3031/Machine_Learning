    "### You are developing a regression model to predict house prices.\n",
    "    Dataset contains:\n",
    "    House Size (sqft)\n",
    "    Number of Tiles\n",
    "    Total Construction Cost\n",
    "    Number of Bedrooms\n",
    "    Market Price\n",
    "    After calculating correlation matrix, you find:\n",
    "    House Size and Number of Tiles have 0.98 correlation\n",
    "    Construction Cost is highly correlated (0.95) with House Size\n",
    "### ❓ Question:\n",
    "    Why is high correlation between features a problem?\n",
    "    Which feature(s) would you remove and why?\n",
    "    What issue can occur if highly correlated features are kept?\n",
    "    Which filter method is appropriate here?"

    "    1. High correlation causes multicollinearity; coefficients become unstable, hard to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Drop Tiles; keep Size, optionally drop Cost (redundant with Size).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Kept together: inflated standard errors/VIF, unstable estimates, unreliable interpretation.\n",

    "    4. Use correlation-threshold filter (correlation-based feature selection) to drop redundancies."
