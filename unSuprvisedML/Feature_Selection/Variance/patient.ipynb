    "## Scenario: Hospital Disease Prediction System\n",
    "    You are building a machine learning model to predict whether a patient has a particular disease.\n",
    "#### The dataset contains the following features:\n",
    "    Age\n",
    "    Blood Pressure\n",
    "    Cholesterol Level\n",
    "    Gender\n",
    "    Country Code\n",
    "    Hospital ID\n",
    "    'Machine Version Used for Testing\n",
    "    After initial exploration, you notice:\n",
    "    Country Code is 100% “India” for all records\n",
    "    Machine Version is 99% “v2.1” and only 1% “v2.2”\n",
    "    Hospital ID is same for all patients'\n",
    "### ❓ Question:\n",
    "    Which feature selection technique would you apply first?\n",
    "    Which features would likely be removed?\n",
    "    Why is removing these features important before training?\n",
    "    What problem might occur if you keep them?"

    "    4. some non tree model fails to predict the output when the variance is very low\n",
